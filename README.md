## IR Mouse:
**Iris mouse was created by Pranav Asrani, with assistance of CNN from https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/06/image-processing-using-cnn-a-beginners-guide/**

_This mouse is powered by different modules such as:_\
-->pynput\
-->numpy\
-->opencv-python\
-->pyautogui\
-->tensorflow\
-->keras\

**For setup, simply run `setup.py` after cloning this repo. If you want to install in a virtual environment, simply create the environment then clone into it.**
This dataset is already trained. if you want to train again,then delete all images from `cnndata\` Then run `data_collection.py` \
Once you input in all fields, click anywhere and look at the mouse while clicking. Your iris will be recorded.

To run, simply run `python3 prediction.py`

Enjoy!
